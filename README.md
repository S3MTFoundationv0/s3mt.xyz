## Project Overview


- **Institutional-grade custody** via decentralized price oracles
- **Presale mechanism** to bootstrap initial liquidity and community participation
- **On-chain yield distribution** from protocol fees and revenue streams
- **Burn-to-value** redemption allowing holders to redeem tokens for real-world value
- **DAO Governance** empowering token holders to propose and vote on protocol upgrades

## Key Features

- **Presale Smart Contract**: Anchor-based Solana program to manage token presale.
- **Yield Distributor**: Automatically distributes fees proportionally to token holders.
- **Redemption Mechanism**: Burn tokens for USD stablecoins or underlying assets.
- **DAO Module**: Governance framework for on-chain proposal and voting.
- **Oracle Integration**: Reliable price feeds from Chainlink or Pyth network.

## Technology Stack

- **Blockchain**: Solana
- **Smart Contracts**: Rust, Anchor framework
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 (Vue 3, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS
- **Wallet Integration**: @solana/wallet-adapter
- **Containerization**: Docker, Traefik, local Solana Validator
- **Build & Automation**: Node.js, Yarn, Makefile scripts

## Makefile Commands

The S3MT project provides a Makefile to streamline common tasks related to Docker services, image builds, and one-off commands. Below is a summary of the most frequently used targets:

- `make dev [s=<service>]`          : Start the development environment for all services or a specific service.
- `make up [s=<service>]`           : Bring up Docker containers for all services or a specific service.
- `make down [s=<service>]`         : Stop and remove containers for all services or a specific service.
- `make start [s=<service>]`        : Start specific services defined in `tmp/start.txt`.
- `make stop [s=<service>]`         : Stop running containers without removing them.
- `make restart [s=<service>]`      : Restart containers for all services or a specific service.
- `make logs [s=<service>]`         : Tail logs for all services or a specific service.
- `make build s=<service> [tag=<tag>] [type=<type>]`: Build a Docker image for a service (default `type=base`).
- `make dbuild s=<service> [tag=<tag>]`: Build a Docker image with development proxy settings (`haproxy_dev.cfg`).
- `make rebuild s=<service>`        : Rebuild the main app image after code changes.
- `make recopy s=<service>`         : Copy updated files into a container without a full rebuild.
- `make run s=<service> cmd="<command>"`: Run a one-off command in a new container.
- `make exec s=<service> cmd="<command>"`: Execute a command in a running container.
- `make sh s=<service>`             : Open a shell in a running container.
- `make pull [s=<service>]`         : Pull the latest image for a service from the registry.
- `make reboot [s=<service>]`       : Alias for restarting services (stop & up).
- `make update [s=<service>]`       : Update services by pulling code and rebuilding images.
- `make import-vector [d=<dir>]`    : Initialize schema and populate vector DB from WordPress.
- `make programs`                   : Show installed Solana programs on the local validator.
- `make add-app s=<service>`        : Scaffold a new app in the project.

For a full list of available targets and detailed usage, run `make` without arguments or inspect the Makefile at the project root.
